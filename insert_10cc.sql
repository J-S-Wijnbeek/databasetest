    '10cc are an English rock band formed in Stockport in 1972. The group initially consisted of four musicians – Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme – who had written and recorded together since 1968. The group is known for their clever and innovative pop songs, including hits like "I''m Not In Love", "The Things We Do for Love", and "Dreadlock Holiday". "I''m Not In Love" became their breakthrough hit in 1975, reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US. The song is notable for its innovative production techniques and lush, layered vocals. The band''s name allegedly comes from the average amount of ejaculate in a single male orgasm (9cc), with an extra 1cc added for effect, though the band has given various other explanations over the years. 10cc are known for their musical sophistication, wit, and eclectic style, blending elements of art rock, pop, and progressive rock.',
